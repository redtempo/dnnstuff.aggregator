# Aggregator Documentation

## About

The Aggregator module is a DotNetNuke module capable of showing any number of
tabs, each tab with any number of modules within it. In addition to
modules, each tab can display it's own html text before the modules. You
can include this text in a tab without showing any modules at all if you
wish, which effectively turns the Aggregator module into a tabbed html
text module. The html text displayed in the tab is fully indexed by the
internal DNN search mechanism as well.
